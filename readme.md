# TT Backup
My personal script to back up TT servers on Linux.

## Notes
This assumes that you are using Daniel Nashes TeamTalk server manager thing to manage TT servers, at least its path and directory structure is assumed to be the same.

You can [download that here](https://nashcentral.duckdns.org/builds/teamtalkbuild.tar.gz).

Currently it only backs up XML files. If you would like it to back up everything, remove the "/*.xml" from the script.

Note: You will have to run this in a cronjob (not documented here yet).

Improvements are always welcome; please open an issue or send in a PR!

Enjoy!
